    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

      <h2>Our Promise</h2>
      <p>Pebble is a forward-thinking technology company with multiple patents pending. But more than that, we are a values-first organisation that puts people before data.</p>
      <p>We believe privacy is a right — not a feature. This policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information. Spoiler: we collect as little as possible.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What We Collect</h2>
      <p>When you use our services (like scanning a tag or registering an item), we may collect the minimum information needed to make the system work. This can include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A name or nickname (optional)</li>
        <li>A contact method like email or phone number (optional, and encrypted)</li>
        <li>The unique ID of your tag</li>
        <li>Any message or photo you choose to share</li>
        <li>Finder information (automatically deleted after 7 days)</li>
        <li>Basic system logs (for security and diagnostics)</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What We Don’t Do</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We don’t track your movements or location.</li>
        <li>We don’t sell your data. Ever.</li>
        <li>We don’t profile you.</li>
        <li>We don’t advertise or retarget you.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why We Collect Anything At All</h2>
      <p>We only collect what’s needed to help someone return a lost item to you, or to notify you of a found tag. That’s it.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Finder Privacy</h2>
      <p>If someone finds your item and submits their details, we treat their privacy the same way: with care and respect.</p>
      <p><strong>Finder details are automatically deleted after 7 days — always.</strong></p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Retention</h2>
      <p>Most data is stored for only as long as needed to operate the system. You can request full deletion at any time by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@pebble.id">privacy@pebble.id</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>We use modern encryption, secure servers, and minimal attack surfaces. Your information is encrypted in transit and at rest. Sensitive fields are one-way hashed or encrypted wherever possible.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Access and Control</h2>
      <p>You’re in control. You can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>View your tag info</li>
        <li>Edit or update it</li>
        <li>Delete it entirely</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We make this easy — no account or login required.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Changes</h2>
      <p>If we ever change this policy, we’ll let you know on our website and keep prior versions available for comparison. We won’t suddenly switch sides on you.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Contact</h2>
      <p>Have questions? Just ask. We’re a small team and we care.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
      <p>Pebble was built on trust, dignity, and clarity. We don’t believe in tricking users, monetizing confusion, or burying the truth in fine print.</p>
      <p><strong>We keep what’s needed, and nothing more.</strong></p>
